      "news" : ["Pico today announced the Pico 4 standalone VR headset, with pricing and content aspirations that make it clear the company hopes to compete directly with Quest 2. The headset will launch in October starting in Europe and some Asian regions, with no plans for a US launch just yet.\n            Pico has been making VR headsets for years, though the company has primarily served the enterprise market thus far. More recently the company was acquired by ByteDance and earlier this year took its first serious step into the consumer VR space with the release of the Pico Neo 3 Link, a standalone VR headset that also has the ability to tether to a desktop for PC VR gaming.\n            Less than a year later the company is nearly ready to release the Pico 4, and this time around it hopes to get a leg up on Meta’s Quest 2 headset in price and features, while angling to be competitive on content as well.\"    \n            ","\n            HaptX, which makes-enterprise focused haptic VR gloves, has announced the closure of a $23 million investment. The company says it will use the cash to accelerate the rollout of its next-gen products.\n\n            HaptX has been enhancing and refining its enterprise-focused haptic VR gloves for several years now. In addition to force-feedback, the company also touts its micro-pneumatic haptics which push against your skin to mimic the feeling of an object pushing back when you grip it. Though bulky and expensive, HaptX has the most convincing haptic VR gloves I’ve tried yet.\n            "]
